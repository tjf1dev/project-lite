## Q&A
### How do i get my token?

> There are a few ways to get your token, but we don't recommend pasting code into your console.
> Here is the recommended one:
> 1. Log in into your Discord Web App
> 2. Open the DevTools Tab using `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
> 3. Go to the Network tab and press `F5` (this will disconnect you from vc's)
> 4. Find a record saying `@me`, `preview` or `country-code`
> 5. In the headers view search for Authorization and copy it.
> 6. That's your token! Paste it into the input token field to log in. Make sure to save it well so others cant access it!

> [!CAUTION]
> NEVER share your token with anyone. This can make someone log in without password or 2FA.
### Help! My username is None!
> This is a known issue for versions <0.1.0. If you logged in and it shows your info on `about` its okay.
